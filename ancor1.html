    <h2>about</h2>
    <p> 1962, with the success of the Fantastic Four, Marvel Comics editor and head writer Stan Lee was 
        casting for a new superhero idea. He said the idea for Spider-Man arose from a surge in teenage demand
         for comic books and the desire to create <a href="https://www.canva.com/" style="display: none;">marder content</a>  a character with whom teens could identify.[15]: 1  As with 
         Fantastic Four, Lee saw Spider-Man as an opportunity to "get out of his system" what he felt was missing in 
          books.[16] In his autobiography, Lee cites the non-superhuman pulp magazine crime fighter the Spider as a 
          great influence,[14]: 130 [17] and in a multitude of print and video interviews, Lee stated he was inspired by 
          seeing a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man">wikipedia</a>  bfr  pider climb up a wall—adding in his autobiography that he has told that story so often he has become u
          nsure of whether or not this is true.[note 1] Besides the name, the Spider was wanted by both the law and the cr
          iminal underworld (a defining theme of Spider-Man's early years) and had through years of ceaseless struggle dev
          eloped a "sixth sense", which warns him of danger, the inspiration for Spider-Man's "spider-sense".[17] Although
           at the time teenage superheroes were usually given names ending with "boy", Lee says he chose "Spider-Man"

    <p id="rahul">uses found that college students ranked Spider-Man and fellow Marvel hero the Hulk alongside Bob Dylan and
           Che Guevara as their favorite revolutionary icons. One interviewee selected Spider-Man because he was "beset
            by 
           woes, money problems, and the question of existence. In short, he is one of us."[8]: 223  Following Ditko's 
           departure after issue #38 (July 1966), John Romita Sr. replaced him as penciller and would draw the series for 
           the next several years. In 1968, Romita would also draw the character's extra-length stories in the comics 
           magazine The Spectacular Spider-Man, a proto-graphic novel designed to appeal to older readers. It lasted for 
           two issues and represented the first Spider-Man spin-off publication, aside from the original series' summer 
           Annuals that began in 1964.[35]
